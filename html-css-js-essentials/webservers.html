        A <strong>web server</strong> is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP
        (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS.
        A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler,
        initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message.
        A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.
